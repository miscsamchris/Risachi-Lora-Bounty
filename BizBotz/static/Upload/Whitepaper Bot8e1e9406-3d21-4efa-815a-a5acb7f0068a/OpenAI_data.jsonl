The disadvantages are:  It mandates the usage of DOT as the validator staking token for all participating chains, thus reducing architectural options for developers of Polkadot chains;  It introduces a significant level of friction for developers of Polkadot blockchains who are required to bid and lock significant amounts of DOT in order for their chains to become part of the ecosystem;  It facilitates a token-only governance model, which excludes other relevant stakeholders of the ecosystem from decision making;  Economic support it facilitates can not last indefinitely, since the token treasury will eventually get depleted. 2.5 Aave (Aave) AAVE is the native token of Aave, an on-chain token lending platform. Given that AAVE is not a protocol but an application token, we do not analyze its design, advantages and disadvantages. The relevance of AAVE for POL design is twofold:  AAVE is the successor of LEND, the initial native token of Aave; the Aave community executed a successful and beneficial migration from LEND to AAVE;  AAVE provides its holders governance rights via a comprehensive governance model. 3 Design goals Based on the analysis of relevant work, several major opportunities for POL to benefit the Polygon ecosystem were identified. These opportunities are brought forward here as POL design goals. 1. Ecosystem security . POL should help establish a highly decentralized pool of validators that can run and secure any Polygon chain. Validators should be incentivized to join and stay in the validator pool and help secure as many chains as possible, and at the same time disincentivized to do anything malicious. 2. Infinite scalability. POL should support exponential growth of the Polygon ecosystem and eventual hyperblochainization of the world. Primarily, it should enable the validator pool to scale to support thousands of Polygon chains. 7'\n\nb'3. Ecosystem support. Being a global network in the making, Polygon will require ongoing economic support for further development and growth. POL should help establish a self-sustaining funding mechanism for those activities. This funding vehicle should be governed by the Polygon community. 4. No friction . Blockchain networks often require both users and developers to hold, stake or consume their native tokens in order to use the network. This causes friction and degrades user and developer experience. POL should be designed in a way that does not introduce any such friction. 5. Community ownership. Polygon is envisioned as a decentralized network governed by its community. Assigning governance rights to POL holders can enable creation of effective governance models in which decision makers are directly incentivized to support proposals that are in the best interest of the Polygon ecosystem. 4 Utility POL is the native token of Polygon, and as such represents the major tool for coordination and incentivization of the whole Polygon ecosystem. It has multi-fold utility, namely:  Validator staking;  Validator rewards;  Community ownership, i.e. governance. 4.1 Validator staking Polygon validators are required to stake POL in order to join the validator pool. Validator staking increases security of the ecosystem by:  Preventing Sybil attacks;  Aligning validators with the success of the ecosystem;  Enabling slashing, i.e. punishment of malicious validators. By staking POL and joining the validator pool, validators become eligible to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. Validation and its benefits for validators are further explained in  6.3. 8'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "1.

Since the inception in 2020, the Polygon ecosystem has grown to thousand of applications and 3 million daily transactions 7 . If this trend even remotely continues, the proposed growth scenarios seem realistic.  Web2 app marketplaces: The App Store hosts around 1.8 million applications 8 and Google Play around 2.7 million 9 ; both were introduced around 14 years ago. It could be reasonable to expect a comparable level of adoption for Web3 in a comparable timeframe.  Supernets adoption: At the moment of writing this paper, one year since the introduction of Supernets, there are more than 100 Supernets candidate projects, many of them under active development. Based on this, the proposed growth scenarios for Supernets seem realistic, especially given that Supernets deployment should become significantly easier once the Staking Layer (described in  6) is introduced. Additionally, it is noticeable that the trend of interest in Supernets is stronger in relative terms than the one for public chains. For this reason, we are assuming the same for the proposed growth scenarios. To further justify this, a meaningful parallel with Web2 adoption history can be drawn.

The frequency of these checkpoints can be configured (e.g. every 5 minutes).  Data availability: The data availability model can also be specified. Chains can decide to leverage Ethereum (rollup model) or their own validator sets or other external data availability service (validium model). With the proposed framework, launching a new Polygon chain practically boils down to writing and deploying the aforementioned config smart contract. Once the contract gets deployed to the Staking Layer, validators can start subscribing to it. When the minimal required number of validators is reached, the chain gets launched. We believe that this simple way of configuring and launching chains can usher a new era of innovation and adoption. The game-changing design decision of Ethereum was to not try to predict what applications and use cases developers will want to build. Instead, it offered a Turing-complete programmable environment that can support any application or use case. With the Staking Layer, Polygon is taking the same approach for launching new chains  it supports practically any chain design, in a programmable manner and without scaling limitations. 6.3 Validator management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of validators. It manages validators throughout their whole lifecycle and enables them to secure different types of incentives for performing useful work. There are four possible phases, i.e. statuses, in the validator lifecycle: 1. Activation: Validators get initiated as part of the validator pool by depositing POL into the staking contract on the Staking Layer. Once initiated, validators become eligible to receive base protocol rewards (described in  4.2). 2. Subscription: Once initiated, validators are allowed to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. 3. Validation: If a validator meets all the criteria of the Polygon chain it subscribed to, it becomes a member of that chains validator set. Validators can validate multiple chains, and their POL stake is acknowledged on each of those chains. If a validator gets slashed for a predefined slashable offense on one of the chains, its POL balance gets updated and reflected on all chains it validates.

Instead, and in order to get better understanding of this POL-powered layer and its potential, we provide an overview of its following aspects:  Design and implementation;  Polygon chains management;  Validator management. 6.1 Design and implementation As mentioned above, the Staking Layer is a programmable multi-chain coordinator. It manages two main logical components: 1. Validator registry: Maintains the up-to-date registry of validators, with their corresponding POL stakes and chains they are subscribed to; 2. Chain registry: Maintains the up-to-date registry of Polygon chains, with their corresponding configurations. The main feature the Staking Layer requires is full programmability; it allows it to support and coordinate:  Arbitrary configurations of Polygon chains;  All validator-related operations;  Arbitrary supporting operations and applications, e.g. staking derivatives. The optimal way to achieve programmability is by utilizing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), since it provides a number of benefits:  Turing-completeness;  Maturity of the EVM, higher level languages (e.g. Solidity) and tooling;  Developer base etc. Practically, this means that the Staking Layer will be implemented as a set of EVM smart contracts. These smart contracts can be deployed on any EVM blockchain, likely on Ethereum or Polygon zkEVM rollup, given that both offer a high level of security. 6.2 Polygon chains management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains, each with arbitrary features and configuration, and provide them the required level of decentralization. 13'\n\nb' Governance. The design of ATOM has the following advantages:  It is a productive asset, its holders can participate in securing Cosmos Hub and receive incentives for doing that;  It does not introduce security and sustainability concerns, given that it doesnt have supply cap;  It provides economic support to the ecosystem via a predetermined allocation to the stewarding foundation;  It gives its holders governance rights via a comprehensive governance model. The disadvantages of ATOM design:  It only has utility within Cosmos Hub; it is not used to run and secure other chains in the ecosystem, although there are initiatives to enable this;  It facilitates a token-only governance model, which excludes other relevant stakeholders of the ecosystem (developers, prominent contributors, applications etc.) from decision making;  Economic support it facilitates can not last indefinitely, since the token treasury will eventually get depleted. 2.4 Polkadot (DOT) DOT is the native token of the Polkadot multi-chain ecosystem.

In return for validating Polygon chains, validators can establish at least three incentive streams: 1.

To remain on the current growth trajectory, the Polygon ecosystem will need ongoing economic support in years to come. 16'\n\nb'Lastly, it is important to note that the emission policy we propose has a high degree of predictability. The predetermined emission schedule makes POL supply predictable in the long term, even if the community decides to intervene. As explained, the community can only decrease the rates, thus effectively complementing the predetermined emission policy and potentially increasing scarcity of POL. Predictability and scarcity attract protocol and market participants and provide a sense of reliability. As the Polygon ecosystem continues to grow, this should contribute to establishing POL as an attractive and reliable digital asset, which subsequently could further ignite adoption and reliability, thus creating a virtuous circle. 6 Staking Layer Realizing the vision of the Value Layer of the Internet will eventually require the Polygon network to host billions of users and millions of Web3 applications. To enable this vast level of activity, hundreds or thousands of Polygon chains will be running in parallel, secured by tens or hundreds of thousands of validators. In order to coordinate all Polygon chains and validators, the redesigned Polygon protocol architecture introduces the Staking Layer. The Staking Layer is a one-of-a-kind programmable multi-chain coordinator protocol. By orchestrating all Polygon validators and chains, it enables:  Unlimited scalability of the ecosystem;  Simple, automated access to dedicated Web3 infrastructure to any Web3 project. The Web3 industry was started by Bitcoin, the first successful blockchain with a single application  digital currency. As new applications and use cases were being proposed, they were normally launching their own blockchains, which was slow and complex. This was addressed by the second major breakthrough of Web3  Ethereum, a programmable blockchain that can support any application or use case. Despite being a huge paradigm shift, the main limitation of Ethereum is that it is not able to scale to support mainstream adoption. To mitigate this limitation, the Ethereum community turned to Layer 2 chains  blockchain architectures that offer higher scalability without sacrificing security. With the introduction of Staking Layer, Polygon becomes capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Layer 2 chains, each fully programmable both on the application and the configuration level. We believe this can be the third most important breakthrough since the commencement of Web3, given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it enables. 12'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "6.

As the successor of MATIC, POL is envisioned to become an instrumental tool for coordination and growth of the Polygon ecosystem and the main driver of the vision of Polygon as the Value Layer for the Internet. We start by analyzing relevant work, identifying opportunities and threats and, based on that, we establish POL design goals. We propose design, utility and tokenomics of POL that achieve all the design goals. We describe the concept of the Staking Layer, a one-of-a-kind, POL-powered chain coordinator, capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains with arbitrary features and configurations. We believe the introduction of the Staking Layer and the wider Polygon 2.0 architecture can establish Polygon as the third most important and impactful breakthrough in Web3 (the first two being Bitcoin and Ethereum), given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it can facilitate. We introduce the Community Treasury, an in-protocol, community-governed fund designed to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. We describe the process of migration from MATIC to POL. To analyze the proposed design, we define an economic simulation model and run simulations to confirm the hypothesis of the model, derived from the aforementioned design goals. Based on everything above, we conclude that POL is a novel, next generation asset that provides a solid foundation for the ambitious vision of the Value Layer.'\n\nb'overlap; a single validator can be in the subscription phase on one Polygon chain and in the validation phase on another. 4.

During that period, the ecosystem will need economic support. Once the Polygon ecosystem and Web3 reach maturity, transaction fees and other incentives secured by validating Polygon chains (described in  6.3) should alone generate sufficient returns for Polygon validators. Once that happens, the community can decide to intervene and reduce or completely discontinue the emission for validator rewards, without impacting security and decentralization of the ecosystem. Similarly, the community can then decide to decrease or discontinue the emission for the Community Treasury as well, given that the ecosystem will not need significant economic support anymore. Obviously, the adoption cycle of Web3 might look slightly or completely different. In case it turns out that reaching mainstream adoption takes more time and the ecosystem still needs support after 10 years, the community can choose not to intervene and the emission will continue to happen for as long as required. We consider the proposed emission policy optimal, as it achieves the equilibrium between:  Sufficient ecosystem support. Sufficient, future-proof support to the Polygon ecosystem is critically important for security and success of Polygon. To validate the hypothesis that the proposed emission rates are indeed sufficient, we developed an economic model, ran simulations and presented results in  9.  Security via scarcity. Scarcity of native tokens is instrumentally important for blockchain networks; high token dilution can dramatically affect security. To estimate POL scarcity, we can compare the proposed emission rate to the emission rate of BTC, which is currently at 1.8% 3 , and has been significantly higher in the past. Also, although gradually declining, BTC emission is guaranteed to happen for more than another century, whilst POL emission could potentially be reduced or discontinued even after 10 years. Given that (i) Bitcoin is considered a highly scarce asset, and (ii) total POL emission rate is comparable to (and potentially more strict than) BTC, we conclude that POL is sufficiently scarce, i.e. its emission does not introduce protocol security concerns. 3 Source: https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-inflation/ 11'\n\nb'Contents 1.

The frequency of these checkpoints can be configured (e.g. every 5 minutes).  Data availability: The data availability model can also be specified. Chains can decide to leverage Ethereum (rollup model) or their own validator sets or other external data availability service (validium model). With the proposed framework, launching a new Polygon chain practically boils down to writing and deploying the aforementioned config smart contract. Once the contract gets deployed to the Staking Layer, validators can start subscribing to it. When the minimal required number of validators is reached, the chain gets launched. We believe that this simple way of configuring and launching chains can usher a new era of innovation and adoption. The game-changing design decision of Ethereum was to not try to predict what applications and use cases developers will want to build. Instead, it offered a Turing-complete programmable environment that can support any application or use case. With the Staking Layer, Polygon is taking the same approach for launching new chains  it supports practically any chain design, in a programmable manner and without scaling limitations. 6.3 Validator management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of validators. It manages validators throughout their whole lifecycle and enables them to secure different types of incentives for performing useful work. There are four possible phases, i.e. statuses, in the validator lifecycle: 1. Activation: Validators get initiated as part of the validator pool by depositing POL into the staking contract on the Staking Layer. Once initiated, validators become eligible to receive base protocol rewards (described in  4.2). 2. Subscription: Once initiated, validators are allowed to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. 3. Validation: If a validator meets all the criteria of the Polygon chain it subscribed to, it becomes a member of that chains validator set. Validators can validate multiple chains, and their POL stake is acknowledged on each of those chains. If a validator gets slashed for a predefined slashable offense on one of the chains, its POL balance gets updated and reflected on all chains it validates.

This implies that POL would be widely distributed from day one, which is instrumental for overall decentralization and resilience of the ecosystem. 5.2 Emission POL is emitted at a predefined, deterministic rate for two purposes: 1. Validator rewards. To incentivize validator onboarding and retention, POL should be continuously emitted at a predetermined rate and distributed to validators as the base, protocol reward. We propose a yearly emission rate of 1% of the POL supply for this purpose. The emission rate would not be possible to change for the initial 10 years, and after that period the community can decide to decrease it in an arbitrary way via the governance framework. The emission rate can never be increased beyond 1%. 2. Ecosystem support. To provide ongoing support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem, we propose to introduce the Community Treasury, a community-governed ecosystem fund, described in  7. We propose a yearly emission rate of 1% of the POL supply for this purpose. Just like the emission for validator rewards, this emission rate can be decreased after 10 years via a governance framework, and it can never be increased beyond 1%. Figure 2. Possible POL emission rate scenarios The rationale for the proposed emission and the emission rates is that the Polygon ecosystem and Web3 in general will need time to mature and reach mainstream adoption.

The utility of BTC is twofold:  Miner rewards: The protocol emits BTC and distributes it to protocol validators, aka miners;  Transaction fees: Users pay fees in BTC for every transaction, which prevents spam and provides additional incentives for miners. One advantage of the BTC design is a deterministic, i.e. predictable supply. Normally, tokens with deterministic supply are more attractive to holders and can capture value better than those with non-deterministic supply. We consider BTC a legacy token design and we argue its disadvantages are multifold:  It is an unproductive asset, it does not give its holders any meaningful role in the protocol nor the incentives to performs such a role;  It does not leverage the opportunity to require stake in the native token for protocol validators and instead requires them to stake, i.e. invest external resources (mining equipment and electricity), thus making protocol less resilient and self-sustainable;  It gradually reduces emission for mining rewards until it reaches zero, which introduces sustainability and security concerns (it is unclear if the security can be maintained once the emission rate becomes low or reaches zero);  It does not introduce any type of economic support to the ecosystem;  It does not give any governance rights to holders, although it can be argued that Layer 1 protocols such as Bitcoin should not utilize tokens for governance. 2.2 Ethereum (ETH) ETH is the native token of the Ethereum protocol and ecosystem.

To incentivize validator onboarding and retention, predefined amounts of POL should be continuously distributed to Polygon validators as protocol rewards. Protocol rewards should be distributed to validators proportionally to the amount of POL they stake. POL emission is described in  5.2. Protocol rewards provide base incentives for validators and establish a level playing field for the whole validator pool. On top of it, validators can then secure additional incentives by validating individual Polygon chains. Additional validator incentives are described in  6.3. 4.3 Governance To facilitate efficient, community-run governance of important aspects of the Polygon ecosystem, POL should be technically enabled to hold governance rights, i.e. be utilized in governance frameworks. Describing the Polygon governance framework is out of the scope of this paper. 5 Supply Here we cover the initial supply and the emission policy of POL, and describe the rationale behind both. 5.1 Initial supply The initial supply of POL is 10 billion tokens. The entirety of the initial supply should be dedicated for migration, i.e. token swap from MATIC to POL. This migration would need to take place in order for POL to succeed MATIC as the native token of the Polygon ecosystem, and it is discussed in  8. The initial supply of POL matches the supply of MATIC, which should make the migration quite straightforward. Once the migration is complete, the distribution of POL would essentially match the current distribution of MATIC. MATIC has already gone through an extensive process of token distribution which has resulted in more than 600,000 holder addresses 2 , and likely even more 2 Source: https://etherscan.io/token/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0#balances 9'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "9.

Instead, and in order to get better understanding of this POL-powered layer and its potential, we provide an overview of its following aspects:  Design and implementation;  Polygon chains management;  Validator management. 6.1 Design and implementation As mentioned above, the Staking Layer is a programmable multi-chain coordinator. It manages two main logical components: 1. Validator registry: Maintains the up-to-date registry of validators, with their corresponding POL stakes and chains they are subscribed to; 2. Chain registry: Maintains the up-to-date registry of Polygon chains, with their corresponding configurations. The main feature the Staking Layer requires is full programmability; it allows it to support and coordinate:  Arbitrary configurations of Polygon chains;  All validator-related operations;  Arbitrary supporting operations and applications, e.g. staking derivatives. The optimal way to achieve programmability is by utilizing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), since it provides a number of benefits:  Turing-completeness;  Maturity of the EVM, higher level languages (e.g. Solidity) and tooling;  Developer base etc. Practically, this means that the Staking Layer will be implemented as a set of EVM smart contracts. These smart contracts can be deployed on any EVM blockchain, likely on Ethereum or Polygon zkEVM rollup, given that both offer a high level of security. 6.2 Polygon chains management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains, each with arbitrary features and configuration, and provide them the required level of decentralization. 13'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "10.

As the Polygon ecosystem continues to grow, this should contribute to establishing POL as an attractive and reliable digital asset, which subsequently could further ignite adoption and reliability, thus creating a virtuous circle. 6 Staking Layer Realizing the vision of the Value Layer of the Internet will eventually require the Polygon network to host billions of users and millions of Web3 applications. To enable this vast level of activity, hundreds or thousands of Polygon chains will be running in parallel, secured by tens or hundreds of thousands of validators. In order to coordinate all Polygon chains and validators, the redesigned Polygon protocol architecture introduces the Staking Layer. The Staking Layer is a one-of-a-kind programmable multi-chain coordinator protocol. By orchestrating all Polygon validators and chains, it enables:  Unlimited scalability of the ecosystem;  Simple, automated access to dedicated Web3 infrastructure to any Web3 project. The Web3 industry was started by Bitcoin, the first successful blockchain with a single application  digital currency. As new applications and use cases were being proposed, they were normally launching their own blockchains, which was slow and complex. This was addressed by the second major breakthrough of Web3  Ethereum, a programmable blockchain that can support any application or use case. Despite being a huge paradigm shift, the main limitation of Ethereum is that it is not able to scale to support mainstream adoption. To mitigate this limitation, the Ethereum community turned to Layer 2 chains  blockchain architectures that offer higher scalability without sacrificing security. With the introduction of Staking Layer, Polygon becomes capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Layer 2 chains, each fully programmable both on the application and the configuration level. We believe this can be the third most important breakthrough since the commencement of Web3, given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it enables. 12'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "11.
