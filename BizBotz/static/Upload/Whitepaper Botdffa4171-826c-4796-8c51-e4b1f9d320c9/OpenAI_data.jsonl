We describe the concept of the Staking Layer, a one-of-a-kind, POL-powered chain coordinator, capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains with arbitrary features and configurations. We believe the introduction of the Staking Layer and the wider Polygon 2.0 architecture can establish Polygon as the third most important and impactful breakthrough in Web3 (the first two being Bitcoin and Ethereum), given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it can facilitate. We introduce the Community Treasury, an in-protocol, community-governed fund designed to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. We describe the process of migration from MATIC to POL. To analyze the proposed design, we define an economic simulation model and run simulations to confirm the hypothesis of the model, derived from the aforementioned design goals.

The predetermined emission schedule makes POL supply predictable in the long term, even if the community decides to intervene. As explained, the community can only decrease the rates, thus effectively complementing the predetermined emission policy and potentially increasing scarcity of POL. Predictability and scarcity attract protocol and market participants and provide a sense of reliability. As the Polygon ecosystem continues to grow, this should contribute to establishing POL as an attractive and reliable digital asset, which subsequently could further ignite adoption and reliability, thus creating a virtuous circle. 6 Staking Layer Realizing the vision of the Value Layer of the Internet will eventually require the Polygon network to host billions of users and millions of Web3 applications. To enable this vast level of activity, hundreds or thousands of Polygon chains will be running in parallel, secured by tens or hundreds of thousands of validators. In order to coordinate all Polygon chains and validators, the redesigned Polygon protocol architecture introduces the Staking Layer. The Staking Layer is a one-of-a-kind programmable multi-chain coordinator protocol. By orchestrating all Polygon validators and chains, it enables:  Unlimited scalability of the ecosystem;  Simple, automated access to dedicated Web3 infrastructure to any Web3 project. The Web3 industry was started by Bitcoin, the first successful blockchain with a single application  digital currency. As new applications and use cases were being proposed, they were normally launching their own blockchains, which was slow and complex. This was addressed by the second major breakthrough of Web3  Ethereum, a programmable blockchain that can support any application or use case. Despite being a huge paradigm shift, the main limitation of Ethereum is that it is not able to scale to support mainstream adoption. To mitigate this limitation, the Ethereum community turned to Layer 2 chains  blockchain architectures that offer higher scalability without sacrificing security. With the introduction of Staking Layer, Polygon becomes capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Layer 2 chains, each fully programmable both on the application and the configuration level. We believe this can be the third most important breakthrough since the commencement of Web3, given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it enables. 12'\n\nb'1 Vision The vision behind Polygon as the Value Layer of the Internet is to usher a world in which value can be created and exchanged freely and globally, similarly to how we create and exchange information today.

POL should help establish a self-sustaining funding mechanism for those activities. This funding vehicle should be governed by the Polygon community. 4. No friction . Blockchain networks often require both users and developers to hold, stake or consume their native tokens in order to use the network. This causes friction and degrades user and developer experience.

The disadvantages are:  It mandates the usage of DOT as the validator staking token for all participating chains, thus reducing architectural options for developers of Polkadot chains;  It introduces a significant level of friction for developers of Polkadot blockchains who are required to bid and lock significant amounts of DOT in order for their chains to become part of the ecosystem;  It facilitates a token-only governance model, which excludes other relevant stakeholders of the ecosystem from decision making;  Economic support it facilitates can not last indefinitely, since the token treasury will eventually get depleted. 2.5 Aave (Aave) AAVE is the native token of Aave, an on-chain token lending platform. Given that AAVE is not a protocol but an application token, we do not analyze its design, advantages and disadvantages. The relevance of AAVE for POL design is twofold:  AAVE is the successor of LEND, the initial native token of Aave; the Aave community executed a successful and beneficial migration from LEND to AAVE;  AAVE provides its holders governance rights via a comprehensive governance model. 3 Design goals Based on the analysis of relevant work, several major opportunities for POL to benefit the Polygon ecosystem were identified. These opportunities are brought forward here as POL design goals. 1. Ecosystem security . POL should help establish a highly decentralized pool of validators that can run and secure any Polygon chain. Validators should be incentivized to join and stay in the validator pool and help secure as many chains as possible, and at the same time disincentivized to do anything malicious. 2. Infinite scalability. POL should support exponential growth of the Polygon ecosystem and eventual hyperblochainization of the world. Primarily, it should enable the validator pool to scale to support thousands of Polygon chains. 7'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": " How does Polygon improve scalability for Ethereum?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Polygon improves scalability for Ethereum by introducing a redesigned protocol architecture that turns Polygon into a network of ZK-powered L2 chains.

We believe this can be the third most important breakthrough since the commencement of Web3, given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it enables. 12'\n\nb'Contents 1. Polygon vision  3 2.

We simulated ongoing Community Treasury inflows in  9. 8 Migration Given that POL is being proposed as the successor of MATIC, the current native token of Polygon, migration from the old to the new token would need to take place. The initial supply of POL proposed in  5.1 matches the current supply of MATIC and was proposed to simplify the migration process as much as possible. For self-custodying MATIC holders, the migration would require a simple action  swap from MATIC to POL, using the swapping smart contract that should be created for that purpose. The swapping contract should accept MATIC from any address and return the equivalent amount of POL to the same address. For MATIC holders who keep their tokens with centralized crypto exchanges and custodians, the migration would normally be automatic, i.e. would not require any action. Every MATIC holder should be able to swap their tokens for POL, including those who have MATIC locked for multiple years in various DeFi or vesting contracts, or the uninformed holders who find out about POL at some point in the future. For this reason, the migration should be allowed to happen during a prolonged period of time (e.g. 4 years), if not indefinitely. The migration should be voluntary, i.e. it cannot be forced. However, if POL is accepted by the majority of the community as the new native token, there will be little to no reason to hold MATIC instead of POL. In this situation, it is reasonable to expect that the migration will practically be fully executed, i.e. the vast majority of MATIC will be migrated. 9 Model Based on the design of POL and the Staking Layer, we propose a model to simulate important performance indicators of the POL-powered ecosystem, provide required inputs and analyze the results of simulations. 18'\n\nb'POL: One token for all Polygon chains Mihailo Bjelic Sandeep Nailwal Amit Chaudhary Wenxuan Deng mihailo@polygon.org sandeep@polygon.org amit@chainsolid.com w d e n g @ p o l y g o n . o r g Abstract This paper proposes POL, the native token of the revised Polygon protocol architecture, commonly referred to as Polygon 2.0.

Based on everything above, we conclude that POL is a novel, next generation asset that provides a solid foundation for the ambitious vision of the Value Layer.'\n\nb'4.2 Validator rewards Decentralization and size of the validator pool is critically important for security, resilience and neutrality of the whole Polygon ecosystem. To incentivize validator onboarding and retention, predefined amounts of POL should be continuously distributed to Polygon validators as protocol rewards. Protocol rewards should be distributed to validators proportionally to the amount of POL they stake. POL emission is described in  5.2. Protocol rewards provide base incentives for validators and establish a level playing field for the whole validator pool. On top of it, validators can then secure additional incentives by validating individual Polygon chains. Additional validator incentives are described in  6.3. 4.3 Governance To facilitate efficient, community-run governance of important aspects of the Polygon ecosystem, POL should be technically enabled to hold governance rights, i.e. be utilized in governance frameworks. Describing the Polygon governance framework is out of the scope of this paper. 5 Supply Here we cover the initial supply and the emission policy of POL, and describe the rationale behind both. 5.1 Initial supply The initial supply of POL is 10 billion tokens. The entirety of the initial supply should be dedicated for migration, i.e. token swap from MATIC to POL. This migration would need to take place in order for POL to succeed MATIC as the native token of the Polygon ecosystem, and it is discussed in  8. The initial supply of POL matches the supply of MATIC, which should make the migration quite straightforward. Once the migration is complete, the distribution of POL would essentially match the current distribution of MATIC. MATIC has already gone through an extensive process of token distribution which has resulted in more than 600,000 holder addresses 2 , and likely even more 2 Source: https://etherscan.io/token/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0#balances 9'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "6.

Ecosystem support. Being a global network in the making, Polygon will require ongoing economic support for further development and growth. POL should help establish a self-sustaining funding mechanism for those activities. This funding vehicle should be governed by the Polygon community. 4. No friction . Blockchain networks often require both users and developers to hold, stake or consume their native tokens in order to use the network. This causes friction and degrades user and developer experience. POL should be designed in a way that does not introduce any such friction. 5. Community ownership. Polygon is envisioned as a decentralized network governed by its community. Assigning governance rights to POL holders can enable creation of effective governance models in which decision makers are directly incentivized to support proposals that are in the best interest of the Polygon ecosystem. 4 Utility POL is the native token of Polygon, and as such represents the major tool for coordination and incentivization of the whole Polygon ecosystem. It has multi-fold utility, namely:  Validator staking;  Validator rewards;  Community ownership, i.e. governance. 4.1 Validator staking Polygon validators are required to stake POL in order to join the validator pool. Validator staking increases security of the ecosystem by:  Preventing Sybil attacks;  Aligning validators with the success of the ecosystem;  Enabling slashing, i.e. punishment of malicious validators. By staking POL and joining the validator pool, validators become eligible to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. Validation and its benefits for validators are further explained in  6.3. 8'\n\nb' It provides security for the whole ecosystem, i.e. all participating blockchains. The disadvantages are:  It mandates the usage of DOT as the validator staking token for all participating chains, thus reducing architectural options for developers of Polkadot chains;  It introduces a significant level of friction for developers of Polkadot blockchains who are required to bid and lock significant amounts of DOT in order for their chains to become part of the ecosystem;  It facilitates a token-only governance model, which excludes other relevant stakeholders of the ecosystem from decision making;  Economic support it facilitates can not last indefinitely, since the token treasury will eventually get depleted. 2.5 Aave (Aave) AAVE is the native token of Aave, an on-chain token lending platform. Given that AAVE is not a protocol but an application token, we do not analyze its design, advantages and disadvantages. The relevance of AAVE for POL design is twofold:  AAVE is the successor of LEND, the initial native token of Aave; the Aave community executed a successful and beneficial migration from LEND to AAVE;  AAVE provides its holders governance rights via a comprehensive governance model. 3 Design goals Based on the analysis of relevant work, several major opportunities for POL to benefit the Polygon ecosystem were identified. These opportunities are brought forward here as POL design goals. 1. Ecosystem security . POL should help establish a highly decentralized pool of validators that can run and secure any Polygon chain. Validators should be incentivized to join and stay in the validator pool and help secure as many chains as possible, and at the same time disincentivized to do anything malicious. 2. Infinite scalability. POL should support exponential growth of the Polygon ecosystem and eventual hyperblochainization of the world. Primarily, it should enable the validator pool to scale to support thousands of Polygon chains. 7'\n\nb'1 Vision The vision behind Polygon as the Value Layer of the Internet is to usher a world in which value can be created and exchanged freely and globally, similarly to how we create and exchange information today. A world which enables new  fairer, more inclusive and more efficient  forms of human organizations and governance. We strongly believe that realizing this vision can significantly advance our society. In order to make this ambitious vision a reality, Polygons infrastructure must improve. Specifically, it must become exponentially more scalable, without sacrificing security and user experience. To address this, a reimagined protocol architecture is being introduced as part of the Polygon 2.0 effort. This radical redesign turns Polygon into a network of ZK-powered L2 chains, unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol. The network can support a practically unlimited number of chains, and cross-chain interactions can happen seamlessly and instantly without additional security or trust assumptions. This design fully delivers on the aforementioned requirement  exponential scalability without sacrificing security and user experience. Figure 1. Polygon protocol architecture To coordinate, secure and grow this powerful network, an advanced, well-designed protocol economy and mechanism design are necessary. This inspired the creation of POL. 3'\n\nb'Lastly, it is important to note that the emission policy we propose has a high degree of predictability. The predetermined emission schedule makes POL supply predictable in the long term, even if the community decides to intervene. As explained, the community can only decrease the rates, thus effectively complementing the predetermined emission policy and potentially increasing scarcity of POL. Predictability and scarcity attract protocol and market participants and provide a sense of reliability. As the Polygon ecosystem continues to grow, this should contribute to establishing POL as an attractive and reliable digital asset, which subsequently could further ignite adoption and reliability, thus creating a virtuous circle. 6 Staking Layer Realizing the vision of the Value Layer of the Internet will eventually require the Polygon network to host billions of users and millions of Web3 applications. To enable this vast level of activity, hundreds or thousands of Polygon chains will be running in parallel, secured by tens or hundreds of thousands of validators. In order to coordinate all Polygon chains and validators, the redesigned Polygon protocol architecture introduces the Staking Layer. The Staking Layer is a one-of-a-kind programmable multi-chain coordinator protocol. By orchestrating all Polygon validators and chains, it enables:  Unlimited scalability of the ecosystem;  Simple, automated access to dedicated Web3 infrastructure to any Web3 project. The Web3 industry was started by Bitcoin, the first successful blockchain with a single application  digital currency. As new applications and use cases were being proposed, they were normally launching their own blockchains, which was slow and complex. This was addressed by the second major breakthrough of Web3  Ethereum, a programmable blockchain that can support any application or use case. Despite being a huge paradigm shift, the main limitation of Ethereum is that it is not able to scale to support mainstream adoption. To mitigate this limitation, the Ethereum community turned to Layer 2 chains  blockchain architectures that offer higher scalability without sacrificing security. With the introduction of Staking Layer, Polygon becomes capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Layer 2 chains, each fully programmable both on the application and the configuration level. We believe this can be the third most important breakthrough since the commencement of Web3, given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it enables. 12'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "7.

As the successor of MATIC, POL is envisioned to become an instrumental tool for coordination and growth of the Polygon ecosystem and the main driver of the vision of Polygon as the Value Layer for the Internet. We start by analyzing relevant work, identifying opportunities and threats and, based on that, we establish POL design goals. We propose design, utility and tokenomics of POL that achieve all the design goals.

It introduces at least three major benefits to the Polygon ecosystem:  Ongoing, self-sustainable economic support for as long as required;  Increased decentralization by reducing dependency on the Polygon Foundation;  Achieving the next level of transparency and community inclusion. As described in  5.2, the Community Treasury is funded by a predetermined emission of POL. The emission rate dedicated to this purpose is 1% per year, or 100 million POL in absolute terms, and can not be changed for 10 years. This guarantees strong ecosystem support during this period, critical for development, growth and positioning of Polygon. Once the Polygon ecosystem and Web3 reach maturity, the ecosystem will likely not need significant economic support anymore. At that point, the community should intervene and decrease or discontinue the emission for the Community Treasury. In an optimistic scenario, where maturity is reached before the 10-year period of guaranteed funding expires, the Community Treasury might end up having more funds than the ecosystem realistically needs. In that case, the community should decide how to utilize this excess POL. For example, a decision can be made to burn it. As mentioned, and as the name indicates, the Community Treasury should be governed by the community, via an agreed upon governance process. The governance process and the wider Polygon governance framework are being designed and established as part of the Polygon 2.0 effort, and explaining them in detail is out of the scope of this paper. Instead, we give a brief overview of its two likely concepts: 1. Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs): Formal proposals for funding or other activities or improvements related to the Community Treasury. PFPs can be submitted by anyone, and should be publicly available and discussed. Similar concepts can be observed in other prominent governance frameworks 4 , 5 . 2. Consensus gathering: The process of making a decision on a specific PFP. The decision can be made in a direct manner, where every community member can participate, or via delegates who represent the community. As mentioned in  4.3, POL should be technically enabled to hold governance rights, so it can potentially be utilized 5 https://docs.aave.com/governance/ 4 https://uniswap.org/governance 17'\n\nb'1 Vision The vision behind Polygon as the Value Layer of the Internet is to usher a world in which value can be created and exchanged freely and globally, similarly to how we create and exchange information today.

Again, the number of Polygon chains is an abstract concept in our model; in conjunction with the number of transactions per chain, it should primarily reflect the level of economic activity in the ecosystem. Similarly, the prevalence, i.e. ratio of Supernets compared to public chains, is an abstract, conservative assumption. If it would turn out that public chains are more popular relative to Supernets, the results of the simulation presented in  9.4 would look similar or better, due to their respective transaction fee levels. To complement the aforementioned growth scenarios, we estimate the following inputs:  Initial supply of 10 billion POL, as described in  5.1;  Yearly emission rate of 1% for validator incentives, as described in  5.2;  Yearly emission rate of 1% for the Community Treasury, as described in  5.2;  $5 average POL price during the 10-year period;  38 transactions/second on average per public chains, comparable to current Polygon PoS chain usage 10 ;  19 transactions/second on average per Supernet, an estimate based on the requirements of Supernet projects;  $0.01 average transaction fee on public chains, an estimate based on current average fees on Polygon PoS chain; 11  $0.001 average transaction fee on Supernets, conservative estimate given abundant blockspace and a race to the bottom that it will likely cause for transaction fees;  100 validators on average per public chain, equivalent to the current validator set size of Polygon PoS;  15 validators on average per Supernet, based on requirements and realistic needs of Supernet candidates;  $6,000/year average running costs per validator, equivalent to current Polygon PoS data, gradually decreasing according to a modified version of Moores Law (50% decrease in 3 years). It is worth noting that POL price, although one of the required model inputs, directly and significantly affects only the Community Treasury inflow, not the other key performance indicators.

Retirement: Validators can leave the validator pool at any point. Once the retirement is initiated, a predefined waiting period commences, allowing for potential pending slashing. After the waiting period, validators are able to withdraw their POL stake from the deposit contract. In return for validating Polygon chains, validators can establish at least three incentive streams: 1. Protocol rewards: As described above, every active Polygon validator is receiving base protocol rewards. The total POL emission for validator rewards (described in  5.2), is distributed to active validators proportionally to their POL stake. 2. Transaction fees: Validators are allowed to validate any number of Polygon chains. In return, these chains will normally award the entirety or a portion of transaction fees to validators. 3. Additional rewards: As mentioned above, some Polygon chains can choose to introduce additional rewards to attract more validators. These rewards can be in any token, including but not limited to POL, stablecoins or native tokens of those Polygon chains. As we describe validator incentives, it is worth noting that the concept of validation in Polygon is broader than the usual, narrow definition. This further improves the value proposition of the validator role  in addition to validating multiple chains, validators can also perform multiple roles on a single chain. The most common roles will likely be:  Validation in the narrow sense: Accepting user transactions, determining their validity and generating blocks;  Proving: Producing zero-knowledge proofs of transaction validity;  Data availability: Providing guarantees that transaction data is published and publicly available. 7 Community Treasury The Polygon ecosystem and the whole Web3 industry are still in the early adoption and heavy development phase. To remain on the current growth trajectory, the Polygon ecosystem will need ongoing economic support in years to come. 16'\n\nb'Lastly, it is important to note that the emission policy we propose has a high degree of predictability. The predetermined emission schedule makes POL supply predictable in the long term, even if the community decides to intervene.

Predictability and scarcity attract protocol and market participants and provide a sense of reliability.

The frequency of these checkpoints can be configured (e.g. every 5 minutes).  Data availability: The data availability model can also be specified. Chains can decide to leverage Ethereum (rollup model) or their own validator sets or other external data availability service (validium model). With the proposed framework, launching a new Polygon chain practically boils down to writing and deploying the aforementioned config smart contract. Once the contract gets deployed to the Staking Layer, validators can start subscribing to it. When the minimal required number of validators is reached, the chain gets launched. We believe that this simple way of configuring and launching chains can usher a new era of innovation and adoption. The game-changing design decision of Ethereum was to not try to predict what applications and use cases developers will want to build. Instead, it offered a Turing-complete programmable environment that can support any application or use case. With the Staking Layer, Polygon is taking the same approach for launching new chains  it supports practically any chain design, in a programmable manner and without scaling limitations. 6.3 Validator management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of validators. It manages validators throughout their whole lifecycle and enables them to secure different types of incentives for performing useful work. There are four possible phases, i.e. statuses, in the validator lifecycle: 1. Activation: Validators get initiated as part of the validator pool by depositing POL into the staking contract on the Staking Layer. Once initiated, validators become eligible to receive base protocol rewards (described in  4.2). 2. Subscription: Once initiated, validators are allowed to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. 3. Validation: If a validator meets all the criteria of the Polygon chain it subscribed to, it becomes a member of that chains validator set. Validators can validate multiple chains, and their POL stake is acknowledged on each of those chains. If a validator gets slashed for a predefined slashable offense on one of the chains, its POL balance gets updated and reflected on all chains it validates.

The Web3 industry was started by Bitcoin, the first successful blockchain with a single application  digital currency.

This was addressed by the second major breakthrough of Web3  Ethereum, a programmable blockchain that can support any application or use case. Despite being a huge paradigm shift, the main limitation of Ethereum is that it is not able to scale to support mainstream adoption. To mitigate this limitation, the Ethereum community turned to Layer 2 chains  blockchain architectures that offer higher scalability without sacrificing security. With the introduction of Staking Layer, Polygon becomes capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Layer 2 chains, each fully programmable both on the application and the configuration level.

Retirement: Validators can leave the validator pool at any point. Once the retirement is initiated, a predefined waiting period commences, allowing for potential pending slashing. After the waiting period, validators are able to withdraw their POL stake from the deposit contract. In return for validating Polygon chains, validators can establish at least three incentive streams: 1. Protocol rewards: As described above, every active Polygon validator is receiving base protocol rewards. The total POL emission for validator rewards (described in  5.2), is distributed to active validators proportionally to their POL stake. 2. Transaction fees: Validators are allowed to validate any number of Polygon chains. In return, these chains will normally award the entirety or a portion of transaction fees to validators. 3. Additional rewards: As mentioned above, some Polygon chains can choose to introduce additional rewards to attract more validators. These rewards can be in any token, including but not limited to POL, stablecoins or native tokens of those Polygon chains. As we describe validator incentives, it is worth noting that the concept of validation in Polygon is broader than the usual, narrow definition. This further improves the value proposition of the validator role  in addition to validating multiple chains, validators can also perform multiple roles on a single chain. The most common roles will likely be:  Validation in the narrow sense: Accepting user transactions, determining their validity and generating blocks;  Proving: Producing zero-knowledge proofs of transaction validity;  Data availability: Providing guarantees that transaction data is published and publicly available. 7 Community Treasury The Polygon ecosystem and the whole Web3 industry are still in the early adoption and heavy development phase.

As the successor of MATIC, POL is envisioned to become an instrumental tool for coordination and growth of the Polygon ecosystem and the main driver of the vision of Polygon as the Value Layer for the Internet. We start by analyzing relevant work, identifying opportunities and threats and, based on that, we establish POL design goals. We propose design, utility and tokenomics of POL that achieve all the design goals. We describe the concept of the Staking Layer, a one-of-a-kind, POL-powered chain coordinator, capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains with arbitrary features and configurations. We believe the introduction of the Staking Layer and the wider Polygon 2.0 architecture can establish Polygon as the third most important and impactful breakthrough in Web3 (the first two being Bitcoin and Ethereum), given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it can facilitate. We introduce the Community Treasury, an in-protocol, community-governed fund designed to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. We describe the process of migration from MATIC to POL. To analyze the proposed design, we define an economic simulation model and run simulations to confirm the hypothesis of the model, derived from the aforementioned design goals. Based on everything above, we conclude that POL is a novel, next generation asset that provides a solid foundation for the ambitious vision of the Value Layer.'\n\nb'Describing and specifying the Staking Layer in detail is out of the scope of this paper. Instead, and in order to get better understanding of this POL-powered layer and its potential, we provide an overview of its following aspects:  Design and implementation;  Polygon chains management;  Validator management. 6.1 Design and implementation As mentioned above, the Staking Layer is a programmable multi-chain coordinator. It manages two main logical components: 1. Validator registry: Maintains the up-to-date registry of validators, with their corresponding POL stakes and chains they are subscribed to; 2. Chain registry: Maintains the up-to-date registry of Polygon chains, with their corresponding configurations. The main feature the Staking Layer requires is full programmability; it allows it to support and coordinate:  Arbitrary configurations of Polygon chains;  All validator-related operations;  Arbitrary supporting operations and applications, e.g. staking derivatives. The optimal way to achieve programmability is by utilizing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), since it provides a number of benefits:  Turing-completeness;  Maturity of the EVM, higher level languages (e.g. Solidity) and tooling;  Developer base etc. Practically, this means that the Staking Layer will be implemented as a set of EVM smart contracts. These smart contracts can be deployed on any EVM blockchain, likely on Ethereum or Polygon zkEVM rollup, given that both offer a high level of security. 6.2 Polygon chains management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains, each with arbitrary features and configuration, and provide them the required level of decentralization. 13'\n\nb'Lastly, it is important to note that the emission policy we propose has a high degree of predictability. The predetermined emission schedule makes POL supply predictable in the long term, even if the community decides to intervene. As explained, the community can only decrease the rates, thus effectively complementing the predetermined emission policy and potentially increasing scarcity of POL. Predictability and scarcity attract protocol and market participants and provide a sense of reliability. As the Polygon ecosystem continues to grow, this should contribute to establishing POL as an attractive and reliable digital asset, which subsequently could further ignite adoption and reliability, thus creating a virtuous circle. 6 Staking Layer Realizing the vision of the Value Layer of the Internet will eventually require the Polygon network to host billions of users and millions of Web3 applications.

It introduces at least three major benefits to the Polygon ecosystem:  Ongoing, self-sustainable economic support for as long as required;  Increased decentralization by reducing dependency on the Polygon Foundation;  Achieving the next level of transparency and community inclusion. As described in  5.2, the Community Treasury is funded by a predetermined emission of POL. The emission rate dedicated to this purpose is 1% per year, or 100 million POL in absolute terms, and can not be changed for 10 years. This guarantees strong ecosystem support during this period, critical for development, growth and positioning of Polygon. Once the Polygon ecosystem and Web3 reach maturity, the ecosystem will likely not need significant economic support anymore. At that point, the community should intervene and decrease or discontinue the emission for the Community Treasury. In an optimistic scenario, where maturity is reached before the 10-year period of guaranteed funding expires, the Community Treasury might end up having more funds than the ecosystem realistically needs. In that case, the community should decide how to utilize this excess POL. For example, a decision can be made to burn it. As mentioned, and as the name indicates, the Community Treasury should be governed by the community, via an agreed upon governance process. The governance process and the wider Polygon governance framework are being designed and established as part of the Polygon 2.0 effort, and explaining them in detail is out of the scope of this paper. Instead, we give a brief overview of its two likely concepts: 1. Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs): Formal proposals for funding or other activities or improvements related to the Community Treasury. PFPs can be submitted by anyone, and should be publicly available and discussed. Similar concepts can be observed in other prominent governance frameworks 4 , 5 . 2. Consensus gathering: The process of making a decision on a specific PFP. The decision can be made in a direct manner, where every community member can participate, or via delegates who represent the community. As mentioned in  4.3, POL should be technically enabled to hold governance rights, so it can potentially be utilized 5 https://docs.aave.com/governance/ 4 https://uniswap.org/governance 17'\n\nb'3.

Blockchain networks often require both users and developers to hold, stake or consume their native tokens in order to use the network. This causes friction and degrades user and developer experience. POL should be designed in a way that does not introduce any such friction. 5. Community ownership. Polygon is envisioned as a decentralized network governed by its community. Assigning governance rights to POL holders can enable creation of effective governance models in which decision makers are directly incentivized to support proposals that are in the best interest of the Polygon ecosystem. 4 Utility POL is the native token of Polygon, and as such represents the major tool for coordination and incentivization of the whole Polygon ecosystem. It has multi-fold utility, namely:  Validator staking;  Validator rewards;  Community ownership, i.e. governance. 4.1 Validator staking Polygon validators are required to stake POL in order to join the validator pool. Validator staking increases security of the ecosystem by:  Preventing Sybil attacks;  Aligning validators with the success of the ecosystem;  Enabling slashing, i.e. punishment of malicious validators. By staking POL and joining the validator pool, validators become eligible to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. Validation and its benefits for validators are further explained in  6.3. 8'\n\nb'overlap; a single validator can be in the subscription phase on one Polygon chain and in the validation phase on another. 4. Retirement: Validators can leave the validator pool at any point. Once the retirement is initiated, a predefined waiting period commences, allowing for potential pending slashing. After the waiting period, validators are able to withdraw their POL stake from the deposit contract. In return for validating Polygon chains, validators can establish at least three incentive streams: 1. Protocol rewards: As described above, every active Polygon validator is receiving base protocol rewards. The total POL emission for validator rewards (described in  5.2), is distributed to active validators proportionally to their POL stake. 2. Transaction fees: Validators are allowed to validate any number of Polygon chains. In return, these chains will normally award the entirety or a portion of transaction fees to validators. 3. Additional rewards: As mentioned above, some Polygon chains can choose to introduce additional rewards to attract more validators. These rewards can be in any token, including but not limited to POL, stablecoins or native tokens of those Polygon chains. As we describe validator incentives, it is worth noting that the concept of validation in Polygon is broader than the usual, narrow definition. This further improves the value proposition of the validator role  in addition to validating multiple chains, validators can also perform multiple roles on a single chain. The most common roles will likely be:  Validation in the narrow sense: Accepting user transactions, determining their validity and generating blocks;  Proving: Producing zero-knowledge proofs of transaction validity;  Data availability: Providing guarantees that transaction data is published and publicly available. 7 Community Treasury The Polygon ecosystem and the whole Web3 industry are still in the early adoption and heavy development phase.

Data availability: The data availability model can also be specified. Chains can decide to leverage Ethereum (rollup model) or their own validator sets or other external data availability service (validium model). With the proposed framework, launching a new Polygon chain practically boils down to writing and deploying the aforementioned config smart contract. Once the contract gets deployed to the Staking Layer, validators can start subscribing to it. When the minimal required number of validators is reached, the chain gets launched. We believe that this simple way of configuring and launching chains can usher a new era of innovation and adoption. The game-changing design decision of Ethereum was to not try to predict what applications and use cases developers will want to build. Instead, it offered a Turing-complete programmable environment that can support any application or use case. With the Staking Layer, Polygon is taking the same approach for launching new chains  it supports practically any chain design, in a programmable manner and without scaling limitations. 6.3 Validator management The Staking Layer can support a practically unlimited number of validators. It manages validators throughout their whole lifecycle and enables them to secure different types of incentives for performing useful work. There are four possible phases, i.e. statuses, in the validator lifecycle: 1. Activation: Validators get initiated as part of the validator pool by depositing POL into the staking contract on the Staking Layer. Once initiated, validators become eligible to receive base protocol rewards (described in  4.2). 2. Subscription: Once initiated, validators are allowed to subscribe to validate any Polygon chain. 3. Validation: If a validator meets all the criteria of the Polygon chain it subscribed to, it becomes a member of that chains validator set. Validators can validate multiple chains, and their POL stake is acknowledged on each of those chains. If a validator gets slashed for a predefined slashable offense on one of the chains, its POL balance gets updated and reflected on all chains it validates. The validation and subscription phases can 15'\n\nb'overlap; a single validator can be in the subscription phase on one Polygon chain and in the validation phase on another. 4.

As the successor of MATIC, POL is envisioned to become an instrumental tool for coordination and growth of the Polygon ecosystem and the main driver of the vision of Polygon as the Value Layer for the Internet. We start by analyzing relevant work, identifying opportunities and threats and, based on that, we establish POL design goals. We propose design, utility and tokenomics of POL that achieve all the design goals. We describe the concept of the Staking Layer, a one-of-a-kind, POL-powered chain coordinator, capable of supporting a practically unlimited number of Polygon chains with arbitrary features and configurations. We believe the introduction of the Staking Layer and the wider Polygon 2.0 architecture can establish Polygon as the third most important and impactful breakthrough in Web3 (the first two being Bitcoin and Ethereum), given the magnitude of innovation and adoption it can facilitate. We introduce the Community Treasury, an in-protocol, community-governed fund designed to provide ongoing economic support for further development and growth of the Polygon ecosystem. We describe the process of migration from MATIC to POL. To analyze the proposed design, we define an economic simulation model and run simulations to confirm the hypothesis of the model, derived from the aforementioned design goals. Based on everything above, we conclude that POL is a novel, next generation asset that provides a solid foundation for the ambitious vision of the Value Layer.'\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "18.

Validation and its benefits for validators are further explained in  6.3. 8'\n\nb'To address the need for ongoing ecosystem support, we propose the Community Treasury, an in-protocol, community-governed ecosystem fund. It introduces at least three major benefits to the Polygon ecosystem:  Ongoing, self-sustainable economic support for as long as required;  Increased decentralization by reducing dependency on the Polygon Foundation;  Achieving the next level of transparency and community inclusion. As described in  5.2, the Community Treasury is funded by a predetermined emission of POL. The emission rate dedicated to this purpose is 1% per year, or 100 million POL in absolute terms, and can not be changed for 10 years. This guarantees strong ecosystem support during this period, critical for development, growth and positioning of Polygon. Once the Polygon ecosystem and Web3 reach maturity, the ecosystem will likely not need significant economic support anymore. At that point, the community should intervene and decrease or discontinue the emission for the Community Treasury. In an optimistic scenario, where maturity is reached before the 10-year period of guaranteed funding expires, the Community Treasury might end up having more funds than the ecosystem realistically needs. In that case, the community should decide how to utilize this excess POL. For example, a decision can be made to burn it. As mentioned, and as the name indicates, the Community Treasury should be governed by the community, via an agreed upon governance process. The governance process and the wider Polygon governance framework are being designed and established as part of the Polygon 2.0 effort, and explaining them in detail is out of the scope of this paper. Instead, we give a brief overview of its two likely concepts: 1. Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs): Formal proposals for funding or other activities or improvements related to the Community Treasury. PFPs can be submitted by anyone, and should be publicly available and discussed. Similar concepts can be observed in other prominent governance frameworks 4 , 5 . 2. Consensus gathering: The process of making a decision on a specific PFP. The decision can be made in a direct manner, where every community member can participate, or via delegates who represent the community. As mentioned in  4.3, POL should be technically enabled to hold governance rights, so it can potentially be utilized 5 https://docs.aave.com/governance/ 4 https://uniswap.org/governance 17'\n\nb'overlap; a single validator can be in the subscription phase on one Polygon chain and in the validation phase on another. 4.
