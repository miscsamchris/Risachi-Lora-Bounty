## Risachi Business AI Finetuning - LoRA
## Problem Statement:
In today's digital landscape, businesses strive to personalize their interactions with customers. However, tailoring AI-driven communications to specific needs often proves challenging due to the lack of accessible tools. This project addresses this issue by providing a solution that enables businesses to input their details and train custom models based on a robust Large Language Model (LLM) text-to-text framework.

## Solution:
The Langchain AI Interface is a full-stack application designed to empower businesses and brands in customizing AI-driven interactions. Our solution leverages the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method and offers fine-tuning capabilities for the Open Source Lllama 3 and OpenAI models.

### Key Features:
1. **RAG Integration:** Incorporating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation technique allows for enhanced contextual understanding and more relevant responses.
2. **Fine-tuning Capability:** Businesses can fine-tune pre-trained models such as Open Source Lllama 3 and OpenAI to better align with their specific requirements.
3. **Custom Dataset Generation:** The tool facilitates the generation of datasets tailored to individual businesses, streamlining the training process.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design makes it simple for businesses to input their details and initiate the training process.
5. **Data Correction:** Easy correction of generated data ensures accuracy and improves the quality of trained models.

### How It Works:
1. **Input Business Details:** Businesses provide their specific details and requirements through the user-friendly interface.
2. **Dataset Generation:** The tool generates a custom dataset based on the provided information.
3. **Data Correction:** Users have the option to review and correct the generated data to ensure accuracy.
4. **Model Training:** Once the dataset is finalized, the custom model is trained using the selected pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques.
5. **Integration:** The trained model can be seamlessly integrated into the business's AI infrastructure for personalized communications and interactions.
